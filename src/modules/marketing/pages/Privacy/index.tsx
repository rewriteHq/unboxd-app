          At Unboxd, your privacy is a priority for us, that's why we collect

          debug any occasional problems that might arise.

          As long as our applications and websites can provide their
          functionality without doing so, we prefer to avoid collecting data
          from you.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          In the cases where we do collect data, we try to be clear about why
          we're collecting it, tell you how long we keep it, and delete it when
          we no longer need it.
