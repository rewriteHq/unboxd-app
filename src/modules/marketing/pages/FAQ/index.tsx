Example: When you create an Item for 50k, we markup and it becomes 52k, when this item is posted online for your contributors, they see 52k and contribute towards 52k. Flutterwave takes their charge from the 52k, instead of an extra charge from the client, the user gets their original 50k and unboxd gets the difference. This way, contributors will not pay any transaction charge to do good (contributing towards a goal), then list creators will not lose any money.',

                use to view the items you have listed and then make part or full
                contribution for you to purchase the item. For even more
                convenience, unboxd lets you share directly to Whatsapp,
                Facebook and Twitter.

                After you share your list with your loved ones anywhere in the
                world, you can begin to receive part or full payment for any of
                the items on your wishlist. The contributions received will be
                saved securely in your wallet and be available for immediate
                transfer once you request to payout.

                Hint: Always follow up with your loved ones so your needs remain
